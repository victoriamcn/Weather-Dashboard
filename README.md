# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This challenge was to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

THe weather dashboard used the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities. Using the 5 Day Weather Forecast API, I needed to pass in coordinates instead of just a city name.

I used `localStorage` to store the user's search history and display it on the left side of the window to the user could search that city again.
